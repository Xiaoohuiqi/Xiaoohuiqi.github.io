Xiaohui Qi is a clinician and a master's student in Medicine at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Over the past eight years, she has received rigorous training in both clinical medicine and scientific research and is capable to work in both dry labs (data mining and statistical analysis using R and Python) and wet labs (animal experiments). During her master's degree, she focused on metabolic risk factors for hepatobiliary cancer and published her findings in peer-reviewed journals as a first or corresponding author. She is currently seeking a Ph.D. position in cancer research in a wet lab or mixed wet/dry lab.

  * **Self-learned courses**: probability and statistics, R, Python, machine learning, epidemiology, cancer biology, endocrinology

**Bachelor of Medicine (M.D. -equivalent)** <span style="float:right;">2014 - 2019</span>  <br/> 
Guangxi Medical University, Guangxi, China <br/>
  * **Major courses**: immunology, medical physics, biochemistry, genetics, pathophysiology, epidemiology, cell biology, histology & embryology, physiology, pharmacology, anatomy, neurology, pathology.

## Research Experience
**Hepatobiliary Cancer Research** <span style="float:right;">2019.11 - present</span>  <br/> 
Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China <br/>
* ### The effect of type 2 diabetes and obesity on biliary tract cancer with cholesterol and total bilirubin adjusted
     * **Responsibility**: principal study designer and independent researcher, thesis selection, research framework development, code building, statistical analysis and data visualization, manuscript writing and preparing for publication, reply to review comments
     * **Method**: multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis
     * **Significance**: This study clarifies that it does not type 2 diabetes and obesity but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) that causes biliary tract cancer. As LDL-C levels can be lowered by lifestyle interventions and drug therapy, this study provides a new perspective on the prevention of biliary tract cancer in obese and diabetic populations with dyslipidemia.

* ### The association between insulin therapy and the risk of biliary tract cancer
  * **Responsibility**: leading study designer and researcher, thesis selection, research framework development, code building, statistical analysis and data visualization, manuscript writing and preparing for publication, reply to review comments
  * **Method**: Cox proportional hazards regression model
  * **Significance**: This study reveals that only the risk of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) increased in insulin users, suggesting that the relationship between insulin therapy and the risk of biliary tract cancer is type-specific. More attention should be paid to diabetic patients with ECC risk factors.

* ### Literature review about the role of insulin and incretin-based drugs in biliary tract cancer
  * **Responsibility**: project leader and correspondence author, thesis selection, conceptualization,literature search, manuscript writing and preparing for publication, reply to review comments
  * **Significance**: This review shows that the complex effects of insulin and incretin-based drugs as well as the heterogeneity of biliary tract cancer prevent a consistent conclusion among the observational studies. We suggest that both epidemiological and experimental studies should classify these drugs and biliary tract cancer specifically into different subtypes during the future investigation.
 
**Obesity and Dyslipidemia Research** <span style="float:right;">2021.03 - 2022.05</span>  <br/> 
Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai China <br/>
* ### The causal relationship between morning plasma cortisol levels and obesity
  * **Responsibility**: primary study designer and independent researcher, thesis selection, research framework development, code building, statistical analysis and data visualization, manuscript writing and preparing for publication, reply to review comments
  * **Method**: bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis
  * **Significance**: This study shows that blunted morning plasma cortisol secretion is responsible for severe obesity. Restoring the normal morning cortisol secretion is important in maintaining healthy body weight.

* ### The acute and lag effects of ambient fine particulate matter on the incidence of dyslipidemia
  * **Responsibility**: research member, code building and statistical analysis
  * **Method**: distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM)
  * **Significance**: This study shows that exposure to ambient PM2.5 has an acute effect on the elevation of circulating lipid levels. People in areas with high PM2.5 pollution should pay attention to daily protection to reduce the risk of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases.
