## Hepatobiliary Carcinoma Research
2020.03 - 2022.09 <br/>
Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine <br/>

### The effect of type 2 diabetes and obesity on biliary tract cancer with cholesterol and total bilirubin adjusted
* **Responsibility**: As a principal study designer and project leader, I mainly guided the thesis selection using pre-existing datasets, selecting models for analysis, developing research framework, building code for statistical models, data visualization, generating publications, and submitting manuscripts.
* **Method**: multivariable Mendelian randomization analysis
* **Significance**: This study clarifies that it does not type 2 diabetes and obesity but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) that causes biliary tract cancer. As LDL-C levels can be lowered by lifestyle interventions and drug therapy, this study provides a new perspective on the prevention of biliary tract cancer in obese and diabetic populations with dyslipidemia.

### The association between insulin therapy and the risk of biliary tract cancer
* **Responsibility**: I generally leading the thesis selection utilizing pre-existing datasets, choosing models for analysis, constructing research framework, writing code for statistical models, data visualization, producing publications, and submitting articles as a principal study designer and project leader.
* **Method**: Cox proportional hazards regression model
* **Significance**: This study reveals that only the risk of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC) increased in insulin users, suggesting that the relationship between insulin therapy and the risk of biliary tract cancer is type-specific. More attention should be paid to diabetic patients with ECC risk factors.

### Literature review about the role of insulin and incretin-based drugs in biliary tract cancer
* **Responsibility**: conceptualization, literature search, manuscript writing, visualization
* **Significance**: This review shows that the complex effects of insulin and incretin-based drugs as well as the heterogeneity of biliary tract cancer prevent a consistent conclusion among the observational studies. We suggest that both epidemiological and experimental studies should classify these drugs and biliary tract cancer specifically into different subtypes during the future investigation.


## Obesity and Dyslipidemia Research
2021.03 - 2022.05  <br/>
Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine <br/>
Supervisors: Prof. Bin Cui & Prof. Min Cao

### The causal relationship between morning plasma cortisol levels and obesity
* **Responsibility**: As the primary study designer and project manager, I was primarily responsible for picking the thesis utilizing pre-existing datasets, choosing models for analysis, designing the research framework, writing the code for the statistical models, data visualization, generating publications, and submitting articles.
* **Method**: bi-directional Mendelian randomization analysis
* **Significance**: This study shows that blunted morning plasma cortisol secretion is responsible for severe obesity. Restoring the normal morning cortisol secretion is important in maintaining healthy body weight.

### The acute and lag effects of ambient fine particulate matter on the incidence of dyslipidemia
* **Responsibility**: The majority of my responses are related to building the code for the statistical models using R programming and data visualization.
* **Method**: distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM)
* **Significance**: This study shows that exposure to ambient PM2.5 has an acute effect on the elevation of circulating lipid levels. People in areas with high PM2.5 pollution should pay attention to daily protection to reduce the risk of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular diseases.
